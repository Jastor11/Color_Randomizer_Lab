# Random Color Generator

## Intro
HTML elements that stay one color for all of eternity are becoming a thing of the past. Create a box that changes color every time you click on it to add a little **fun** to your page.

## Task
Try to recreate the example shown below. Each time you click on the box it should generate a random new color.
Think about the different ways you can set an element's color value.

## Extensions
1. Make three boxes, have each box go through different hues of the same color family each time you click on them.
2. Change the border color on the box too!
  * Have the border alternate through the different possible patterns (solid, dotted, dashed, etc. )
3. Create a new box of the randomly generated color located in a random place in the page every time you click on the original box.
